1.) It took about 3.5 hours to complete this assessment I would say.

2.) I used your code on your GitHub, YouTube videos when I was stuck or couldn't remember how to do something.

3.) I didn't ask my friends any questions during this assessment.

4.) I didn't ask my instructors any questions during this assessment.

5.) I think this was about a 6.5/10 in difficulty for me because there is so much new syntax to learn. I think I could probably solve similar but different problems in the future.
